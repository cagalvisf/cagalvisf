### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Cristian Galvis, I am a physicist who's currently doing a Master's degree at Universidad Nacional de Colombia. In my research I am particulary interested in quantum computing; specifically in qubit state tomography. Nevertheless, I am currently getting into Quantum Cryptography and Quantum Machine Learning algorithms as well as its applications in Quantum Chemestry!

Bellow you can see some stats abput my activity in GitHub. AS you can see I have done contributions for 2 organizations. The first one is called [QC-FEM](https://github.com/QC-FEM); which is an initiative authored by me and a collegue for creating a comunnity which aims to teach quantum computing at its basic level. We developed a little [crash course](https://github.com/QC-FEM/QC-CrashCourse) in quantum computing in spanish. The other osganization I have contributed to is [SuperVeci](https://github.com/SuperVeci). There I worked as a software back and front-end developer using different software languages such as PHP, Node.js, HTML and Java.
