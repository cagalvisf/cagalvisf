### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Cristian Galvis, I am a physicist who's currently doing a Master's degree at Universidad Nacional de Colombia. In my research I am particulary interested in quantum computing; specifically in qubit state tomography. Nevertheless, I am currently getting into Quantum Cryptography and Quantum Machine Learning algorithms as well as its applications in Quantum Chemestry!
