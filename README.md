### Hi there 👋

I'm Cristian Galvis, I am a physicist who's currently doing a Master's degree at Universidad Nacional de Colombia. In my research, I am particularly interested in quantum computing, specifically in qubit state tomography. Nevertheless, I am currently getting into Quantum Cryptography and Quantum Machine Learning algorithms as well as its applications in Quantum Chemistry!

Below you can see some stats about my activity in GitHub. AS you can see I have done contributions to 2 organizations. The first one is called [QC-FEM](https://github.com/QC-FEM); which is an initiative authored by me and a colleague for creating a community that aims to teach quantum computing at its basic level. We developed a [crash course](https://github.com/QC-FEM/QC-CrashCourse) in quantum computing in spanish. The other organization I have contributed to is [SuperVeci](https://github.com/SuperVeci). There I worked as a software back and front-end developer using different software languages such as PHP, Node.js, HTML, and Java.
