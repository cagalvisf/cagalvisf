### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Cristian Galvis, I am a doctoral researcher at Aalto University. In my research, I am particularly interested in quantum computing, specifically in qubit state tomography and Quantum Machine Learning.

Below you can see some stats about my activity in GitHub. AS you can see I have done contributions to 2 organizations. The first one is called [QC-FEM](https://github.com/QC-FEM); which is an initiative authored by me and a colleague for creating a community that aims to teach quantum computing at its basic level. We developed a [crash course](https://github.com/QC-FEM/QC-CrashCourse) in quantum computing in spanish.
